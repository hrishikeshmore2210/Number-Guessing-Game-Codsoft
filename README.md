# Number-Guessing-Game-Codsoft
I created this number game using Java language.
The aim is to create a Java Programm in which a user is given K chances to estimate a randomly generated number. 
The game's rules are as follows:
1. If the guessed number is more than the real number, the program will display the message "guessed number greater than the actual number.
2. If the guessed number is less than the real number, the program will display a message indicating that the guessed number is less than the actual number.
3. If the guessed number is the same as the real number, or if all K trials have been completed, the program will terminate with an appropriate message.
